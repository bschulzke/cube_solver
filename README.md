# Cube Solver
This repo will contain a Cube class for encoding the current state of a Rubik's Cube, a CubeNode class for use in a deterministic search algorithm, and a CubeSolver class that will selectively expand CubeNodes to find the shortest possible solution path. The Cube represents states using a list of strings, to keep the implementation lightweight and allow for efficient searching.
