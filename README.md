# Cube Solver
This repo will contain a Cube class for encoding the current state of a Rubik's Cube, a CubeNode class for use in a deterministic search algorithm to be implemented in the CubeSolver class. The Cube represents states using a list of strings, to keep the implementation lightweight and allow for efficient searching.
